#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The runtime on this is `O(n)`, which is the linear complexity. The size of (n) grows and is increased in the algorithm.

b) The runtime on this is `O(n^2)`, which is the quadratic time complexity. The algorithum has two loops, the second one is nested. We go over the list once, for each loop.

c) The runtime on this is `O(n)`, the linear complexity. Since it's a recursive question and it's looping through one time. 

## Exercise II

To break the least amount of eggs I would begin in the middle. Test to see when you drop an egg, if it breaks or not. If it's fine, then keep moving up half those floors and continue testing when they break. 

I believe this is a binary search problem and would benefit from using 
`O(n log n)`, which means the slope increases slowly.
